Bradford protein assay
1.	Take a 96-well plate
2.	Take out the standards, place on ice until completely thawed
3.	Take the standards in the solution in which the assay is performed. In this case RIPA.
4.	Brad solution should be diluted 1:5. So take 1 part Brad and 4 parts DDW. Add 200 µl to each well. Total 18 wells of standards.
5.	Then in each well add 4 µl of BSA and also 4 µl of test protein.
6.	Add along the wall, burst the bubbles with a needle.
7.	Place on a rocker for 5 minutes
8.	Check for homogeneity
9.	If there is any precipitate - stir with a pipette.
10.	Then place it in the machine.
11.	On the computer select protocol - procedure - absorbance 595. Save in excel format.
